Budget Design Documentation


The budget will first build 2 lists of records, one for income and one for
expenses accounts.  If a list of accounts is given in the options, then
we will use one set of functions to parse through the list of accounts
and build each of the 2 account lists.  If no list of accounts is given in
the options, then we will start with the root account and parse down through
the hierarchy of accounts with another set of functions.

Placeholder accounts that have a budget value assigned to them indicate a
stop point where we want all the children to be rolled up under that account.
For such accounts, we stop processing children.

Placeholders without budget values will be shown with their total actual value
and a sum of their children's budget values. They will not be included in the
grand totals for income or expense.  They will be displayed in a greyed out
font in the report so they can be seen but visually indicated to not be
included in the sum totals.
